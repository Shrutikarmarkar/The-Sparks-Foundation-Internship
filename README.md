# The-Sparks-Foundation-Internship
This is the data science and business analytics Project by The Sparks Foundation. This internship involves performing exploratory data analysis on a sports dataset, specifically focusing on the Indian Premier League (IPL). My objective is to identify the most successful teams, players, and factors that contribute to a team's win or loss.
